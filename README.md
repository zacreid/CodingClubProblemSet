Sorted in order of difficulty

    Coffee Beans

 How it works?
Given an input string of any length if the word Coffee or Beans occurs return the word Coffee Beans
If above statement is not true return 'sleepy'
Must work for capital or lowercase letters
 Words will be separated with a space (' ')
 
Example input "I like coffee", "Beans on toast", "coffee beans", "I only drink tea"
Example output 'Coffee Beans', 'Coffee Beans', 'Coffee Beans', 'sleepy'

    Palindrome

- How it works?
 Given a word (containing higher or lower case letters) if you reversed the word would it stay the same (the word is a palindrome)
 
Example input 'Bob' 'Sally' 'Anna' 'wow'
Example output True False True True

You could improve this example by allowing the input of phrases and sentences! (e.g "Taco Cat" -> True)





    Pythagoras 

- How it works?
a^2 + b^2 = c^2
Given a tuple of 2 values (a, b)
Find c and return (a, b, c)
 
 Example input (3, 4) 
Example output (3, 4, 5)


   


 FizzBuzz

How it works?
If it is divisable by 3 say Fizz
If it is divisable by 5 say Buzz
If both of the above statements are true say FizzBuzz
 
Example output 1, 2, Fizz, 4, Buzz, Fizz, 7, 8, Fizz, Buzz, 11, Fizz, 13, 14, FizzBuzz

   



    Spongebob

How it works?
Get the last digit of any number
If it is even say sponge
If it is divisible by 3 say bob
 If both of the above statements are true say spongebob
If the number is equal to 9 ignore all the statements above and say patrick
Example output 10, 11, Sponge, Bob, Sponge, 15, SpongeBob, 17, Sponge, Patrick, 20


    Prime Three

How it works?
Given an input of a list of numbers find all the numbers that meet the following criteria
A prime number
Contains the number 3
All numbers found that meet this criteria must be then sorted by how many times the number three occurs (numbers with the same number of threes should be sorted according to there numerical value)
 
Example input [2, 3, 10, 55, 37, 323, 533, 333, 22, 103, 57]
Example output [3, 37, 103]
